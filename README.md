# random-number-generator

## quick presentation : 

this project was created as a tool to help me with educational purposes! the generator helped (and still helps me) in revising questions by assigning numbers (custom min-max range) to topics or questions, and randomly selecting one for review (uni lectures, flashcards, ...)

with this method, I not only learned how to deal with Python but also easily covered various topics in a randomized order, making my revision sessions more "dynamic" and challenging rather said :,)

## features : 

- generate a random number within a specified range (here it is customizable according to what you want: 1 to 50, 100 to 18748, 0 to 5, etc...).
- simple and easy to use interface that works with any study guide format or ANY other purpose

## inspiration :

- myself

### of course you are absolutely free to re-use it and re-style it as you need and wish :)

a pleasure!
